# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a fictional game introduced by Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory TV show. This is essentially a classical Rock, Paper, Scissors game and it functions in a way where you are playing vs the computer. Main idea in the game is to pick a character that beats the character that computer picked, now this is where it becomes interesting, in order to beat computer, you need to know which character is more powerful.

You have five options to choose from and the rules are as follows: Rock beats scissors and lizard, paper beats rock and Spock, scissors beat paper and lizard, lizard beats Spock and paper, and Spock beats scissors and rock. And logic for this game goes like this: scissors decapitate lizard, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitate lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

The main idea around this game is to interduce more options to the classical version of the game.
